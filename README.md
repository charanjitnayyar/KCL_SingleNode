# KCL_SingleNode
Solve for a single node voltage in a circuit using Kirchoff's current law

Steps:
1. Enter number of wires connecting to the node

2. Enter voltage at the end of each wire along with the corresponding resistors between them

3. ???

4. Value

Notes: You can use recognised suffix for voltage and resistor values (kilo as k/K, giga as G, milli as m, micro as u, etc).

Folder "/test" contains testbenches for both SingleNode and metric_conv
